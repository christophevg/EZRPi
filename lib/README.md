## Gecko SDK

Until I take the time to verify if and how I can include (parts of) the Gecko SDK, you'll have to download it yourself.

Minimal survival commands:

* Visit [https://www.silabs.com/support/resources](https://www.silabs.com/support/resources)
* Narrow by "Software"
* Search for "Gecko SDK"
* Download "EFM32/EFR32/EZR32 Gecko Software Development Kit". It is (currently) linked to as [https://www.silabs.com/documents/login/software/Gecko_SDK.zip](https://www.silabs.com/documents/login/software/Gecko_SDK.zip)
* Unpack it in this folder.
