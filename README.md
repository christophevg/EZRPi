## Introduction

Dash7 is a specification for an ultra low power network stack, operating within the sub-GHz spectrum. This repository contains all information on the design and implementation of a Raspberry Pi HAT (aka shield) and supporting software to use Dash7 for medium-range wireless communication.

## Credits

Much of this project exists thanks to the [Dash7 Open Source Stack (OSS-7)](https://github.com/MOSAIC-LoPoW/dash7-ap-open-source-stack).
